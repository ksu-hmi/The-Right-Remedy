# The-Right-Remedy

This project determines alternatives for user-inputted pharmaceuticals. When traveling domestically or internationally, medications that people are used to consuming may not be found everywhere. This project will also attempt to hold a list of current pharmaceutical drugs used by the patient, and cross-check for potential interactions. It will also give alternatives to commonly found medications, from simple cough medicine to prescribed, pharmaceutical drugs.
